# hrApp

this is a simple Human resourses app 
the user can do CRUD operation on employees and departments 

I have used angular js for front end 

Spring Boot fro backend 

both have seperate servers that you need to run 

I have supperated them just to mess around with the code 

if you want to run it on one server comment the method in the main controller in back end and move the 
front end files to src/main/resourses/public and run back end server 

anyways
to run front end server run nom install in front end using terminal 

to run backend server use eclipse and run as java application by right clicking in application.java file
